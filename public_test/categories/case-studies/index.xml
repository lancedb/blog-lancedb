The tooling choices are made such that there are no separate processes required to handle database operations. Continue&amp;rsquo;s codebase retrieval features are powered by &lt;a href="https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb">LanceDB&lt;/a>, as it is the only vector database with an embedded TypeScript library that is capable of fast lookup times while being stored on disk and also supports SQL-like filtering.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AnythingLLM's Competitive Edge: LanceDB for Seamless RAG and Agent Workflows</title><link>https://example.org/blog/anythingllms-competitive-edge-lancedb-for-seamless-rag-and-agent-workflows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/blog/anythingllms-competitive-edge-lancedb-for-seamless-rag-and-agent-workflows/</guid><description>&lt;p>AnythingLLM chose LanceDB as their vector database backbone to create a frictionless experience for developers and end-users alike. By leveraging LanceDB&amp;rsquo;s serverless, setup-free architecture, the AnythingLLM team slashed engineering time previously spent on troubleshooting infrastructure issues and redirected it toward building innovative features. The result? An application that works seamlessly across all platforms with zero configuration or setup, empowering users to quickly deploy document chat and agentic workflows while maintaining complete data privacy and control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Second Dinner's Secret Weapon: LanceDB-Powered RAG for Faster, Smarter Game Development</title><link>https://example.org/blog/second-dinners-secret-weapon-lancedb-powered-rag-for-faster-smarter-game-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/blog/second-dinners-secret-weapon-lancedb-powered-rag-for-faster-smarter-game-development/</guid><description>&lt;div class="admonition info">

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://seconddinner.com/">Second Dinner&lt;/a> teamed up with LanceDB Cloud&amp;rsquo;s serverless architecture to turbocharge their game development workflow. Overnight, system designers went from waiting months to spinning up prototypes in hours, slashing endless cross-team coordination. QA engineers, meanwhile, swapped week-long testing marathons for a single API call, achieving superior test coverage and pinpoint accuracy. The kicker? &lt;a href="https://cloud.lancedb.com/">&lt;strong>LanceDB Cloud&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>went from zero to production-ready in just two weeks&lt;/strong>, proving that cutting-edge innovation doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to come with a headache.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WeRide's Data Platform Transformation: How LanceDB Fuels Model Development Velocity</title><link>https://example.org/blog/werides-data-platform-transformation-how-lancedb-fuels-model-development-velocity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/blog/werides-data-platform-transformation-how-lancedb-fuels-model-development-velocity/</guid><description>&lt;div class="admonition info">
