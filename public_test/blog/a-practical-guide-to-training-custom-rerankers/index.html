We&rsquo;ll tackle the important questions, like: <em>When should you implement a reranker? Should you opt for a pre-trained solution, fine-tune an existing model, or build one from scratch?</em></p><p>The retrieval process forms the backbone of RAG or agentic workflows. Chatbots and question-answer systems rely on retrievers to fetch context for every response during a conversation.
Most retrievers default to using vector search. It makes intuitive sense that improved embedding representations should yield better search results.</p><p><img src=/assets/blog/a-practical-guide-to-training-custom-rerankers/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-4.44.51-PM.png alt="Retrieval Process Overview"></p><p>In this blog series, we&rsquo;ll work backwards from the last component of the retrieval process. This blog deals with the reranking aspect of RAG or retrievers.</p><h3 id=so-where-does-reranking-fit-in>So, where does reranking fit in?</h3><p>To understand the importance of reranking models, let&rsquo;s first look at the difference between embedding and ranking models and try to answer this question:</p><p>If enhancing embedding models can yield better search results, why not focus on refining (by fine-tuning) existing models or experimenting with new ones?</p><h2 id=embedding-vs-ranking-models>Embedding vs Ranking models</h2><p>The fundamental difference between embedding and ranking models is</p><ul><li>Embedding models convert any given data point to a vector representation in a given vector space.</li><li>Ranking models rank the data points (or documents in case of text ranking ), based on their relevance to the query</li></ul><p><img src=/assets/blog/a-practical-guide-to-training-custom-rerankers/reranking-scaled.jpg alt="Reranking Process">
<em>source - <a href=https://unfoldai.com/rag-rerankers/>https://unfoldai.com/rag-rerankers/</a></em></p><p>So the** job of an embedding model is to keep semantically similar docs or queries close in a given vector space**. During vector search these similar docs are fetched as probable responses to the query.</p><p>A <strong>reranking model re-arranges this list such that the most relevant answers appear at the top</strong>. Another scenario where reranking is useful is in cases where you need to combine multiple independent search result sets like from both vector search and full-text search.</p><p><strong>Why not use a ranking model for search?</strong></p><p>Ranking is typically a much more expensive operation than vector search. You can&rsquo;t run your entire database row-by-row through a reranker model. Unlike embedding models, you can&rsquo;t create vector representations of docs offline, as ranking models need both the query and docs to calculate the rank.</p><p>Here are some more differences between embedding and ranking models.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Embedding Models</th><th>Reranking Models</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Primary Goal</strong></td><td>Generate vector representations capturing semantics.</td><td>Calculate precise relevance scores for query-item(s) pairs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Input</strong></td><td>Single item (query <em>or</em> document/data point).</td><td>A pair: (query <em>and</em> a candidate item).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Output</strong></td><td>Dense numerical vector (embedding).</td><td>A single relevance score per input pair.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Typical Use</strong></td><td>Initial candidate retrieval, semantic search, clustering.</td><td>Refining/reordering top candidates from retrieval.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stage in Pipeline</strong></td><td>Early stage (candidate generation/retrieval).</td><td>Later stage (refinement/reordering).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Compute Cost</strong></td><td>Generally lower per-item (embeddings often pre-computed).</td><td>Generally higher per-pair (evaluates interaction).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scalability</strong></td><td>High (efficient for large datasets via vector search).</td><td>Lower (applied only to a small subset of candidates).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Architecture</strong></td><td>Encodes items independently.</td><td>Processes query and item together for interaction.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quality vs. Speed</strong></td><td>Optimized for speed & broad recall on large datasets.</td><td>Optimized for precision/quality on a smaller set.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Example</strong></td><td>Encoding docs into vectors for a vector DB.</td><td>Re-ordering top 50 results based on relevance scores.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>In case of cross-encoders, each query-doc pair&rsquo;s similarity is calculated individually. But late interaction based models, like ColBert, calculates doc representations as a batch and reranks them based on MaxSim operation with query representations.</em></p><h2 id=fine-tuning-tradeoffs>Fine-tuning tradeoffs</h2><h3 id=embedding-models>Embedding models</h3><p>Upgrading your embedding model, by either switching to a new model or fine-tuning a base model on your data, <em>can</em> significantly improve the base retrieval performance. However, fine-tuning the embedding model changes the entire embedding space, which may end up harming the overall performance of the model. In addition, it is disruptive operationally because you need to regenerate all of the embeddings. And with many vector databases that only allows one vector field per record, it means managing many different tables for experimentation. For more info on this, you can read up on catastrophic forgetting in LLMs.</p><h3 id=rerankers>Rerankers</h3><p>However, because rerankers are used in the later stage of the retrieval pipeline, you can switch them without disrupting the existing workflow. You can switch models, train new ones, or even get rid of them completely without having to re-ingest your data or update query/source embedders. This tends to be a much easier way to squeeze more quality out of your retrieval pipeline.</p><hr><h2 id=training-rerankers-from-scratch>Training rerankers from scratch</h2><p>This blog deals with reranker models and how you can start off with base LLMs (not base rerankers) and train them on your private data in a few minutes to get significant retrieval performance gains. Of course you can start off with a trained reranker and fine-tune it on your dataset too.</p><p><strong>Dataset</strong></p><p>The dataset used is <a href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/gooaq>gooaq</a> which has over 3M <code>query and answer</code> pairs. Here&rsquo;s it is used for training and eval:</p><ul><li>First, 2M rows are used for training.</li><li>Next 100_000 rows are ingested in LanceDB</li><li>From that 100_000, we take 2000 samples and evaluate the hit rate</li></ul><h3 id=the-baselines>The baselines</h3><p><img src=/assets/blog/a-practical-guide-to-training-custom-rerankers/Screenshot-2025-04-07-at-1.55.57-AM.png alt="Baseline Performance"></p><p><strong>Base Model(s) used:</strong></p><p>For training cross-encoder and ColBert models, we&rsquo;ll use the same two base models:</p><ol><li>MiniLM-v6 - A very small base model with only** ~6Million params**</li><li>ModernBert-base - A relatively larger base model with <strong>~150Million params</strong> (yet much smaller than SOTA reranker models)</li></ol><p>This allows us to look at the tradeoff between model size (and latency) vs quality improvement.</p><h3 id=training-cross-encoders>Training Cross encoders</h3><p>A cross-encoder is a neural network architecture designed for comparing pairs of text sequences. Unlike bi-encoders, which encode texts separately, cross-encoders process both texts simultaneously for more accurate comparisons.</p><p><img src=/assets/blog/a-practical-guide-to-training-custom-rerankers/cross_encoder.png alt="Cross Encoder Architecture"></p><ul><li><strong>Joint Processing</strong>: Both the query and document/passage are concatenated and fed together into a transformer model (like BERT or RoBERTa).</li><li><strong>Cross-Attention</strong>: The transformer applies self-attention across the entire concatenated text, allowing each token to attend to all other tokens in both sequences</li></ul><p><strong>Dataset preprocessing:</strong></p><ul><li>We&rsquo;ll format the train subset of the dataset for training a cross-encoder model using BinaryCrossEntropy loss. To use that loss function, we&rsquo;ll need the dataset is this format: <code>query/anchor, positive, label</code></li><li>Similarly, for evaluating, we&rsquo;ll create the eval such such that it has many negatives like <code>anchor, positive, neg_1, neg_2 ..</code></li></ul><p>Finally, to create the train and test split from the dataset, <strong>we&rsquo;ll mine &ldquo;hard negatives&rdquo; from the given dataset</strong>.</p><p>Hard negatives are negatives that have very similar semantic meaning to the query&rsquo;s positive answer. <strong>We use an independent embedding model to find negatives are semantically close to the query</strong>, also known as anchors.</p><p>To read more in-depth about the training recipe, you can refer to sentence-transformer&rsquo;s cross encoder training <a href=https://huggingface.co/blog/train-reranker#training-components>guide</a>.</p><p>In brief, this is how the training pipeline looks:</p><p><img src=/assets/blog/a-practical-guide-to-training-custom-rerankers/ce.png alt="Cross Encoder Training Pipeline"></p><h3 id=training-colbert-reranker>Training ColBERT reranker</h3><p><img src=/assets/blog/a-practical-guide-to-training-custom-rerankers/1_0vzi15Gl7kbiYunawMKggw--1-.png alt="ColBERT Architecture"></p><p>For training late interaction models like Colbert, we&rsquo;ll use Pylate, a sentence transformer-based library that implements late interaction utils.
