## ðŸ”¥ New Blog: Designing a Table Format for ML Workloads

Zero-copy schema evolution, indices for everything, and parallelized operations - all designed for modern ML. We explain the why & how behind the Lance table format in our latest engineering blog.

## LanceDB Enterprise Product News

### ðŸ”¥ Multivector Search is now live:

Documents can be stored as contextualized vector lists. Fast multi-vector queries are supported at scale, powered by our XTR optimization.

### **ðŸŒ± **LanceDB Cloud UI has a new look

**Search by Project/Table in Cloud UI**: allow users to quickly locate the desired project/table.

**Explore Your Data at a Glance**: preview sample data from any table with a single click.

**`Drop_index` added to SDK**: users can remove unused or outdated indexes from your tables.

## Community Contributions

ðŸ’¡

A simple[**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://github.com/kyryl-opens-ml/mcp-server-lancedb)server implementation for LanceDB has just been released, thanks to our community contributor [@truskovskiyk](https://github.com/truskovskiyk) It provides a semantic memory layer that lets LLMs store and retrieve information using vector embeddings. It works with Claude Desktop and any MCP-compatible application.

## Upcoming Events
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-12.28.10-AM.png)
ðŸ¥³ Microsoft Research Gray Systems Lab is partnering with LanceDB on this exploratory project to explore how to enhance Apache Iceberg's performance by leveraging next-generation file formats like Vortex and Lance. These formats are designed to meet the demands of modern AI/ML workloads and GPU-accelerated analytics, offering advantages such as random data access, support for wide tables, vector encodings, and optimized I/O for cloud environments. We will be presenting at the upcoming [Iceberg Summit on April 8th](https://www.icebergsummit2025.com/) in SF.
