Columnar File Readers in Depth: Compression Transparency

Conventional wisdom states that compression and random access do not go well together. However, there are many ways you can compress data, and some of them support random access better than others. Figuring out which compression we can use, and when, and why, has been an interesting challenge. As we’ve

A Practical Guide to Training Custom Rerankers

A report on reranking, training, & fine-tuning rerankers for retrieval This report offers practical insights for improving a retriever by reranking results. We’ll tackle the important questions, like: When should you implement a reranker? Should you opt for a pre-trained solution, fine-tune an existing model, or build one from scratch? The
