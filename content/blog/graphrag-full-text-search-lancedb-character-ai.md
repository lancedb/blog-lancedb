## ðŸ”¥LanceDB as the Local Vector Database of Choice of GraphRAGðŸ”¥

Microsoft Research open sourced their GraphRAG project last week, and we are excited that the GraphRAG team has decided to launch with LanceDB as the local vectordb of choice! 

[Check the example](https://lnkd.in/gmrsTcqz)

## ðŸ”¬Experimental Native Full Text Search Released in LanceðŸ”¬

- As implemented from scratch in Rust, it works with S3 / GCS directly.  
- FTS will be available in Python, Typescript and Java SDKs in August.
- Experimental encoding for struct column for faster random access.

## Community contributions

ðŸ’¡

**FSST: **Thank you [@broccoliSpicy](https://github.com/broccoliSpicy) for making FSST [available](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/pull/2470). With FSST, we see sizable compression over large string columns, which is especially useful for AI datasets that store text prompts.
