## ⚙️ Lance Format Deep Dives

In addition to our highly requested deep dives into the Lance format, we also shared our perspective on the future of open source table formats — inspired by feedback and questions from the Iceberg community.

Columnar File Readers in Depth: Column Shredding

Record shredding is a classic method used to transpose rows of potentially nested data into a flattened tree of buffers that can be written to the file. A similar technique, cascaded encoding, has recently emerged, that converts those arrays into a flattened tree of compressed buffers. In this article we

Columnar File Readers in Depth: Repetition & Definition Levels

Repetition and definition levels are a method of converting structural arrays into a set of buffers. The approach was made popular in Parquet and is one of the key ways Parquet, ORC, and Arrow differ. In this blog I will explain how they work by contrasting them with validity & offsets

The Future of Open Source Table Formats: Apache Iceberg and Lance

As the scale of data continues to grow, open-source table formats have become essential for efficient data lake management. Apache Iceberg has emerged as a leader in this space, while new formats like Lance are introducing optimizations for specific workloads. In this post, we’ll explore how Iceberg and Lance

## 🎥 Event Recap: AI at Scale with Samsara

The Samsara team is harnessing LanceDB to simplify and streamline AI data infrastructure for massive, real-world datasets.

In May, our cofounder **Chang She** joined **Samsara’s AI Speaker Series**, where he shared cutting-edge insights on **multimodal AI** and the evolving landscape of **AI agents**.

## 🔐 LanceDB Enterprise Product News

- **Smoother concurrent upserts**: Upsert operations are now conflict-free in typical workloads, so you can write without worrying about collisions.
- **Significantly reduced storage costs**: Reduce object store operations by up to 95% with small files loaded with a single I/O instead of multiple IOPS - ideal for small-table workloads.
- **Filter binary data with ease**: Now query large binary columns directly in your filters – no workarounds needed.
- **Optimized GCP deployment tuning:** Fine-tune weak consistency and concurrency limits to better balance performance, cost, and flexibility.
- **Intuitive embedding visualization: **New UMAP visualizations help you explore and understand vector data at a glance.

## 🛠️ Open Source Releases Spotlight 

- **Boolean logic for full-text search**: Combine filters with AND/OR or &/| — full-text search now works the way you think.

    fts_query = MatchQuery("puppy", "text") & MatchQuery("happy", "text")

- **Faster, smarter full-text indexing: **Compression and optimized search algorithms speed up index builds and boost performance at scale.
- **No more stalled upserts: **A new timeout setting ensures `merge_insert` operations won’t hang forever.

    table.merge_insert(id)
            .when_matched_update_all()
            .when_not_matched_insert_all()
            .execute(new_data, timeout=timedelta(seconds=10))
        )

- **Flexible phrase matching: **Control how loose or tight your matches are with the `slop` parameter.

     fts_query=PhraseQuery("frodo was happy", "text", slop=2)

- **Spark compatibility built in: **Works with multiple Spark versions out of the box — just drop in the bundled JAR and go**. **[**Quick start**](https://github.com/lancedb/lance-spark/blob/main/README.md#quick-start)** →**
