## ðŸ’¡ Dive into the future of data management with LanceDB's random access I/O" ðŸ’¡

Random access I/O has traditionally been ignored by columnar formats. One of the reasons we started the Lance file format and have been investigating new encodings is because we wanted a format with better support for random access.

- A new report on [Improving retrievers with LanceDB hybrid search and Reranking](__GHOST_URL__/hybrid-search-and-reranking-report/). This report explores techniques to optimize the retriever's performance without requiring a complete dataset re-ingestion. The experiments on the SQuAD and Llama2-review datasets demonstrated significant improvement. An 11% increase in accuracy on SQuAD (from 81.22% to 92.35%) and a 16% increase in hit-rate on Llama2-review (from 58.63% to 75%)
