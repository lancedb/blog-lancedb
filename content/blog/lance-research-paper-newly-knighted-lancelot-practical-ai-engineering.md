## 📄 The Lance Research Paper 

That's right, we finally published the Lance Research Paper on arXiv. Check out **Lance: Efficient Random Access in Columnar Storage through Adaptive Structural Encodings.**

[Read on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15247)

## 🔍 Columnar File Readers in Depth: Compression and Transparency

A new drop in the Columnar File Reader Deep Dive series. Now read on! 

### [Columnar File Readers in Depth: Compression Transparency](/blog/columnar-file-readers-in-depth-compression-transparency/)

Conventional wisdom states that compression and random access do not go well together. However, there are many ways you can compress data, and some of them support random access better than others. Figuring out which compression we can use, and when, and why, has been an interesting challenge.

## ⚙️ Practical AI Engineering: New How-Tos

We've published two new in-depth guides on advanced techniques for optimizing AI search systems with LanceDB. These guides are intended for engineers and researchers looking to refine model performance and build more effective AI-driven applications. **With the models and code public in the guides.**

### [A Practical Guide to Training Custom Rerankers](/blog/a-practical-guide-to-training-custom-rerankers/)

A report on reranking, training, & fine-tuning rerankers for retrieval. This report offers practical insights for improving a retriever by reranking results. We'll tackle the important questions, like: When should you implement a reranker? Should you opt for a pre-trained solution, fine-tune an existing model, or build one from scratch?

### [A Practical Guide to Fine-tuning Embedding Models](/blog/a-practical-guide-to-fine-tuning-embedding-models/)

This is a follow up to the previous report that deals with improving retrievers by training and fine-tuning reranker models. A comprehensive guide to embedding model optimization.

## Real-World Applications

Explore how leading AI startups are applying LanceDB to advance development and deployment, from our latest case studies:

### 💼 The Future of AI-Native Development is Local: Inside Continue's LanceDB-Powered Evolution

Focused on reshaping the future of AI-native development, [Continue](https://continue.dev/) chose LanceDB to power its local-first, privacy-centric coding environments. LanceDB enabled instant, high-quality semantic search without sacrificing speed, developer control, or security — key pillars for building next-generation AI development tools.

> *"Thanks for all the work that you do! When I found LanceDB, it was exactly what we needed, and has played its role perfectly since then :)" 
> – Nate Sesti, Cofounder & CTO @Continue*

### 💼 AnythingLLM's Competitive Edge: LanceDB for Seamless RAG and Agent Workflows

To build a competitive RAG and agent orchestration platform, [AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/) integrated LanceDB as its retrieval engine — achieving faster, more scalable knowledge retrieval across local and cloud sources. LanceDB's low-latency performance and flexibility helped AnythingLLM deliver a seamless user experience across complex workflows.

> *"With support for Windows ARM, LanceDB is the only VectorDB with seamless experience across platforms and able to run fully on CoPilot AI PCs - something no other vector databases can do at this time. This only affirmed our choice that LanceDB is the best VectorDB provider for on-device AI with AnythingLLM."*

## LanceDB Enterprise Product News

- **Fewer headaches during upserts:** Concurrent writes are now much more reliable, with built-in retries cutting down on 429 errors. Even fewer conflicts coming soon.
- **Easier table rollbacks:** No more version hunting — tag any table state with names like `experiment_v1` and roll back instantly.
- **Know when your index is ready:** The new `wait_for_index` API gives you clear, programmatic visibility into index creation.
- **Search smarter with multiple keywords:** Full-text search now works on string arrays — perfect for filtering by labels or keywords.
- **More flexibility in vector search:** You can now index `float64` vectors, unlocking support for a broader range of models.
