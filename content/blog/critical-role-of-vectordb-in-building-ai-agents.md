Imagine trying to chat with someone but losing track of everything you just said after each sentence. That would be quite frustrating, wouldn‚Äôt it? This is a common hurdle for many AI agents‚Äîthey can perform incredible feats, like answering difficult questions or managing intricate tasks. Yet, they often struggle because they cannot remember past interactions. Like us, even the brightest AI needs a reliable memory to operate effectively.

This is where vector databases like LanceDB step in. It‚Äôs an open-source vector database that enables agents to store, organize, and quickly retrieve the information they require. With LanceDB, agents don‚Äôt have to worry about forgetting after every conversation. Instead, they can effortlessly recall vital information, which boosts their efficiency and improves their decision-making skills. In this blog, we‚Äôll take a closer look at how LanceDB can help tackle the memory issues faced by AI agents.

## **What are AI Agents?**

AI agents are autonomous intelligent systems designed to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with environments independently. Unlike traditional software, they learn from experience and adapt to new situations

### Main Attributes of AI Agents

**- Self-Sufficiency and Intelligence**: AI agents can function autonomously, make decisions, and grow by learning from their environment over time.
**- Critical Thinking**: They assess intricate data, comprehend scenarios, and arrive at informed decisions based on the information available.
**- Task Management**: AI agents can divide large assignments into smaller, actionable steps, devise plans, and adapt their strategies as needed.
**- Adaptive Learning**: They become more proficient over time by learning from their experiences and adjusting to new data without requiring reprogramming.

### How AI Agents operate

1. **Information Gathering**: AI agents collect data from various inputs, including user requests and sensor information.
2. **Reasoning and Interpretation**: They analyze this data to understand the task at hand and determine the best course of action.
3. **Planning**: AI agents outline a structured plan, prioritize their tasks, and consider various approaches to achieve their goals.
4. **Action Execution**: They perform tasks, make decisions, and resolve issues independently.

## **Backbone of Agent‚Äôs Memory**

Agents are usually recognized for understanding complicated prompts, but their real power is their learning and adaptability. To do this right, they need a powerful memory system that can store, sort, and access a lot of information. That‚Äôs where vector databases play a critical role, as it provides:
**- Memory Management**: They enable agents to store and retrieve high-dimensional semantic information efficiently, acting as a long-term memory system that preserves contextual data beyond traditional database capabilities. 
**- Performance Enhancement**: Vector databases dramatically improve AI agent performance by enabling rapid similarity searches, reducing retrieval times up to 100 times more cost-effectively compared to direct large language model queries. 
**- Intelligent Retrieval**: These specialized databases transform unstructured data into meaningful vector embeddings, allowing AI agents to understand, process, and access relevant information instantly, thereby supporting complex decision-making and contextual understanding.

In LanceDB's [vectordb-recipes](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes), there's a section focused on AI agent examples, highlighting various use cases that leverage different frameworks to build intelligent AI agents.

### Assistant bot with OpenAI's Swarm

This example shows a customer service bot that has two parts: one for interacting with users and another for providing help. It includes tools to assist in these tasks. The `run_demo_loop` function in this example helps to create interactive sessions shown in the below image.

This support bot has two main parts:

1. **User Interface Agent**: This part interacts with users at first and directs them to the help center based on what they need.
2. **Help Center Agent**: This part offers detailed help and support using various tools and is connected to a LanceDB VectorDB to retrieve documents.

### AI email assistant with Composio
