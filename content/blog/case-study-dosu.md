## About Dosu

[Dosu](https://dosu.dev) is giving time back to engineers by turning your codebase into a living knowledge base, so you can build instead of answering questions and maintaining docs all day. It generates docs, helps maintain them, answers questions on issues and auto-labels pull requests, issues and discussions on GitHub. With seamless integration into GitHub and Slack, [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) provides context aware, conversational assistance that reduces manual toil and accelerates development workflows. 

[LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) powers [Dosu's](https://dosu.dev) performance engine for multimodal search at scale. Its unique blend of blazing-fast [vector + full-text search](https://lancedb.com/documentation), built-in [reranking](https://lancedb.com/documentation), and [immutable versioning](https://lancedb.com/documentation) enables [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) to handle massively changing datasets (like code, docs, and discussions) with millisecond latency and full historical traceability. LanceDB's lightweight, [local-first architecture](https://lancedb.com/documentation) makes it ideal for secure on-prem deployment and rapid iteration for local development.

By building on [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/), [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) doesn't just respond. It anticipates, accelerates, and elevates how teams build software.

## From Prototype to Production: The Dosu Success Story

In today's fast-moving software landscape, [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) has emerged as the intelligent knowledge base trusted by modern software teams. With over 50,000 GitHub installations and as an official partner of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) transforms AI from a passive tool into an active, context-aware collaborator.

[Dosu](https://dosu.dev) learns your architecture, patterns, and decisions across GitHub and Slack, proactively surfacing relevant Dosu-generated documentation on PRs, answering questions, and resolving issues in context. At the core is a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by high-performance [vector search](https://lancedb.com/documentation) that weaves code, conversations, and documentation into a unified, searchable knowledge graph.

For organizations, [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) is more than a productivity boost. It's a strategic layer that aligns helps to ensure knowledge stays up to date and accurate, so software teams and AI Agents can make better decisions without having to spend half their day on manual maintenance. It helps teams onboard faster, reduces maintenance overhead and preserves institutional knowledge.

For Agents, specifically, [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) is a must have to ensure LLM systems make good decisions based on up to date information, rather than stale documentation. This is an increasingly pernicious problem where agentic AI makes more frequent codebase changes, resulting in documentation that's more difficult to keep up to date, which could lead other AI systems to have wrong or stale context and make increasingly inaccurate decisions. [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) addresses the problem ensuring documentation stays up to date as when changes in code are detected. 

[Dosu](https://dosu.dev) isn't just another AI copilot. It's your always-on intelligent knowledge base, keeping on top of new knowledge when it's created, maintaining context, and accelerating how software teams and the agentic systems that support them build the future.

## The Challenge

### pgvector Didn't Quite Work Out

To power core features like auto-labeling, context-aware documentation, and proactive Q&A, [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) initially turned to pgvector, a straightforward solution that handled basic vector search. But as their AI platform matured, the engineering team hit a major bottleneck.

[Dosu's](https://dosu.dev) core features: auto-labeling, Issue Triage + Q&A, generate docs

As [Dosu's](https://dosu.dev) AI-powered platform matured, its initial choice of pgvector quickly became a bottleneck. With each model iteration, adjusting embedding dimensions, updating schemas, testing similarity metrics, engineers faced tedious database migrations. These migrations, once occasional, became a daily hurdle, especially during rapid prototyping. Instead of building product features, engineers were writing scripts to keep their database in sync.

Performance limitations compounded the problem: deploying pgvector in production was fragile, and scalability was limited. [Dosu](https://dosu.dev) needed a fundamentally different approach, **a vector database that can prioritize developer experience without sacrificing performance at scale, while remaining lightweight enough for seamless deployment**.
