## üé® Semantic.Art

Meet [semantic.art](https://lancedb.com/blog/semanticdotart/), a multi-feature multi-index retrieval art discovery engine that lets you search with a feeling or intent rather than matching keywords.

Powered by [LanceDB](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lancedb/). The core of the system involves dynamically understanding and inspecting a query's intent. It then chooses the best search path on the fly, blending vector, FTS, hybrid search, filtering, and custom rerankers.
