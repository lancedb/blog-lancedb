## What is an Agent?

In the current world where everything is running with and for AI, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have become essential for handling simple queries and generating contextually relevant responses. However, as ever evolving humans, we need complex, autonomous problem-solving methods. In this post, we present, behold: **AI agents** â€” autonomous entities that change how we as humans interact with technology.

#### What are they good for?

- **Autonomous Problem-Solving**: AI agents operate independently, driven by goals rather than specific inputs, and adapt dynamically to new information and environments.
- **Multi-Step Task Execution**: They perform complex, multi-step tasks, maintain state across interactions, and utilize tools like machine learning and rule-based systems to achieve the intended goals.
- **Versatile Capabilities**: From browsing the internet and managing apps to conducting financial transactions and controlling devices, AI agents are reshaping intelligent automation.

### What's LangGraph?

There are many tools available in the market to build agents and among the more popular, are [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm), [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) etc. You can choose any of these but in this post, we'll cover LangGraph, because it offers more granular control and is 100% open source. LangGraph basically creates a "graph" for your workflow, with the following internal components:

1. `State` : Pydantic models or `TypedDict` objects to hold your variables and used for message passing
2. `Node` : It is just a function that does some work. It accepts a `State` object and modifies that state
3. `Tools` : There are pure Python functions or Pydantic models which your agents can call. You use the tools to do retrieval, web Search, calculator or custom API calls, etc. You just have to write the definition of what it does and a rule-based router or model will decide which tool can (but not _should_) be used at any point in time.
4. `Edge` : You have pre-defined flows that define the execution order of functions (i.e., nodes, in our case)
5. `Conditional Edges`  or `Routers`: Instead of fixing the workflow, we can make it conditional. So if you are at node `N`, you decide based on a condition which node to go to next (e.g. `N_i` ... `N_x`).

### Where does RAG Come in?

Remember our `tools` and `Nodes` above? We can define the RAG component of the pipeline either as a tool OR a `Node`. You'll see most tutorials online using RAG as a tool. However, in this post, we'll show how can you use it as a `Node` in a directed graph, and that too, a conditional one.

### Let's build a use case: Email Agent

What this pipeline does is:

1. Fetch the unread emails from your inbox
2. Look at the type of email
3. If it is a policy-related email, it'll use RAG to refer to the policies to draft the email -- otherwise, it just creates a normal draft. If it's spam or something else, it just discards it..
4. Proof-read the draft. If it's good to send, send it, otherwise send it to redraft again. Ideally, you'd let the proof reader node know what are the criteria and then you'd send the reasoning why it was rejected so that the drafting model improves it. That would be out of scope of this blog (wait for a future post ðŸ˜„)
5. Once you get an "OK" from proofreader, send a reply. Ideally, you want an `interrupt` so that the human-in-the-loop (HITL) can review and THEN it gets sent. But again, HITL is a topic for another post...
6. For sending, we just `print` for now

**Yes, all of it is autonomous!**

Let's get some policies and build our RAG on top of this dataset.
You can follow along using the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/customer_support_agent_langgraph/LangGraph_LanceDB.ipynb)

model = get_registry().get("sentence-transformers").create(name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5", device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

class Policy(LanceModel):
    text: str = model.SourceField()
    vector: Vector(model.ndims()) = model.VectorField()

response = requests.get(

        self.db = lancedb.connect(db_path)
        self.table = self.db.create_table(table_name, schema = schema)
        self.table.add([{"text": txt} for txt in re.split(r"(?=\n##)", faq_text)])

    def query(self, query: str, k: int = 5) -> list[dict]:
        result = self.table.search(query).limit(k).to_list()
        return [{"page_content": item["text"], "similarity": 1- item["_distance"]} for item in result]

retriever = VectorStoreRetriever("./lancedb", "company_policy", model, faq_text, Policy)
```

Now that we have our documents ready, let's build some helpers including a dummy function to fetch your email. In the real world, you'd replace it with your own logic and APIs:

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
import os

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

from lancedb.embeddings import get_registry
import numpy as np
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from google.colab import userdata # use os.environ.get()
import os
from colorama import Fore, Style

memory = MemorySaver() # It'll save all the states and history corresponding to a `thread_id`. We can get previous conversations if we use memory

# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo") # use any
def setup_llm():
    return AzureChatOpenAI(
        api_key=userdata.get("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        api_version=userdata.get("AZURE_OPENAI_API_MODEL_VERSION"),
        azure_endpoint=userdata.get("AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT"),
        azure_deployment=userdata.get("AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
        temperature=0.7
    )

def create_dummy_random_emails():
    items = [
        {
            "subject": "Invoice Request for Recent Flight Booking",
            "body": "Dear SWISS Team, I recently booked a flight with SWISS (Booking Reference: LX123456) and would like to request an invoice for my records. Could you please guide me on how to obtain it? Thank you, Anna MÃ¼ller"
        },
        {
            "subject": "Rebooking Inquiry for Upcoming Flight",
            "body": "Hello, I need to change the travel dates for my flight (Booking Reference: LX789012). Can you confirm if this is possible and what fees might apply? Best regards, John Smith"
        },
        {
            "subject": "Cancellation of Flight LX345678",
            "body": "Hi SWISS Customer Service, I need to cancel my flight (Booking Reference: LX345678) due to unforeseen circumstances. Could you please explain the cancellation process and any associated fees? Sincerely, Maria Gonzalez"
        },
        {
            "subject": "Request for Special Invoice for Italy",
            "body": "Dear SWISS, I booked a flight originating in Italy and require a special invoice for tax purposes. Can you assist me with this request? Kind regards, Luca Rossi"
        },
        {
            "subject": "Payment Issue with Credit Card",
            "body": "Hello, I tried to pay for my booking using my Visa card, but the payment failed. Can you confirm if the issue is with my card or the payment system? Thanks, Emily Brown"
        },
        {

            "body": "Dear SWISS, I cancelled my flight (Booking Reference: LX456789) two weeks ago and was told I would receive a refund. Could you provide an update on the status? Best, David Johnson"
        },

            "subject": "Seat Reservation Inquiry",
            "body": "Hi, I have a booking (Reference: LX567890) and would like to confirm if my seat reservation will be retained after a rebooking. Please advise. Regards, Sophie Lee"
        },

            "body": "Dear SWISS, I booked an Economy Flex fare and would like to upgrade to Business Class. Can you guide me on how to proceed? Thank you, Michael Chen"
        },
        {

            "body": "Hello, I am planning to book flights for a group of 12 passengers. Can you provide details on group booking options and any discounts? Best, Sarah Wilson"
        },
        {
            "subject": "Issue with Online Booking Platform",
            "body": "Hi SWISS, I am unable to see my recent booking in my profile on the SWISS website. Can you help resolve this issue? Regards, Thomas Anderson"
        }
    ]
    chosen_items = [random.choice(items) for _ in range(random.randint(0,2))]
    return [Email(id=str(i), sender="some_user@example.mail", subject=item["subject"], body=item["body"]) for i, item in enumerate(chosen_items)]
```

#### Let's set up our Email Agent

First is our `Email` object which defines what an email is. The second one is the `State` which will be used inside the graph.

```python
class Email(BaseModel):
    id: str
    sender: str
    subject: str
    body: str
    final_reply: str = ""
    status: str = "pending"  # pending, sent, failed, skipped
    failure_reason: str = ""

class EmailState(BaseModel):
    emails: List[Email] = [] # List of the Unread above Email class
    processed_emails: List[Email] = [] # Final emails with the replies and denial reason
    current_email: Optional[Email] = None # Pop one everytime from the above list
    policy_context: Optional[str] = "" # Rag context for CURRENT email
    draft: str = "" # Current Draft of the Current Email
    trials: int = 0 # Trails done for Draft <-> Proof Read for current email
    allowed_trials: int = 3 # do Drft <-> Proof Read a max of 3 times
    sendable: bool = False # send the current email if True
    exit:bool = False # There are no unread emails left
```

Let's setup our Agent Classes and simple functions. Names and Prompts are self explanatory.  Our LanceDB-based RAG system is used in the function `lookup_policy` to fetch policies if the query requires searching the internal policies.

```python
class EmailAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = setup_llm() # Replace with your LLM you want

    def fetch_unread_emails(self) -> List[Email]:
        """
        Replace this with your Email LOGIC
        """
        return create_dummy_random_emails()

    def lookup_policy(self, subject: str, body:str) -> str:
        """Always Consult the company policies to answer the queries.
        Use this for drafting the emails"""
        prompt = PromptTemplate(template="Identify whether the given email is policy related or not. Identify if the email requires info which might be in the policy documents.\n\nSubject: {subject}\n\nBody:\n{body}\n\n. Do not output any reasoning etc. Strictly reply with Yes/No", input_variables=["email"])
        chain = prompt | self.llm
        response = chain.invoke({"subject": subject, "body": body})
        policy_related = response.content.strip().lower() == "yes"
        if policy_related:
            docs = retriever.query(f"Email Subject: {subject}\n\nEmail Body:\n{body}", k=2)
            return "\nPolicy Context:" + "\n\n".join([doc["page_content"] for doc in docs])
        return ""

    def draft_email(self, email_subject:str, email_body: str, email_context:str = "") -> str:
        if not email_context:
            prompt = PromptTemplate(template="You are a specialised chat agent named Saleem Shady' working for SWISS Airline. Write a well professional response to this user email:\n\nEmail Subject: {email_subject}\n\nEmail Body:\n{email_body}\n\nResponse:", input_variables=["email"])
        else:
            prompt = PromptTemplate(template="You are a specialised chat agent named Saleem Shady' working for SWISS Airline. Write a well professional response to this user email given the Context (which may or may not be required in answering)\n\n{email_context}\n\nEmail Subject: {email_subject}\n\nEmail Body:\n{email_body}\n\nResponse:", input_variables=["email"])

        chain = prompt | self.llm
        response = chain.invoke({"email_subject":email_subject,"email_body": email_body, "email_context": email_context})
        return response.content

    def validate_draft(self, initial_email: str, draft_email: str) -> bool:
        prompt = PromptTemplate(template="You are a Email Proofreader. Review this response:\n\nOriginal Email:\n{initial_email}\n\nDraft Response:\n{draft_email}\n\nIs this mail ready to send? Do not give your reasoning or views. Reply only with (Yes/No):", input_variables=["initial_email", "draft_email"])
        chain = prompt | self.llm
        response = chain.invoke({"initial_email": initial_email, "draft_email": draft_email})
        return response.content.strip().lower() == "yes"
```

Now, let's setup our main `Workflow`, which is what you've likely been waiting for. The below functions are Either `Nodes` or `Routers`, which we'll get to know when we build the nodes and define edges.

```python
agent = EmailAgent()

def fetch_emails(state: EmailState) -> EmailState:
    emails = agent.fetch_unread_emails()
    state.emails = emails
    return state

def process_next_email(state: EmailState) -> EmailState:
    if state.emails:
        state.current_email = state.emails.pop(0)
        state.policy_context = agent.lookup_policy(state.current_email.subject, state.current_email.body)
    else:
        state.exit = True
    return state

def draft_email(state: EmailState) -> EmailState:
    if state.current_email:
        state.draft = agent.draft_email(state.current_email.subject, state.current_email.body, state.policy_context)
        state.trials += 1
    return state

def validate_draft(state: EmailState) -> EmailState:
    if state.current_email and state.draft:
        state.sendable = agent.validate_draft(state.current_email.body, state.draft)
    return state

def decide_next_step(state: EmailState) -> str:
    if state.sendable:
        print("\n\n-----------------------Sending Email ---------------\n\n")
        return "send"
    elif state.trials >= state.allowed_trials:
        state.current_email.status = "failed"
        state.current_email.failure_reason = "Failed after 3 attempts"
        print("\n\n*********************** Draft Failed after Max Tries ******************** \n\n")
        return "stop"
    else:
        return "rewrite"

def send_or_skip_email(state: EmailState) -> EmailState:
    if state.current_email.status != "failed":
        print(f"\n\nSending email: {state.draft}")
        state.current_email.final_reply = state.draft
        state.current_email.status = "sent"
        state.processed_emails.append(state.current_email)

    # Reset state for the next email
    state.current_email = None
    state.draft = ""
    state.trials = 0
    state.policy_context = ""
    return state
```

Let's Define the `Nodes` and `Edges / Conditional Edges`

```python
workflow.add_node("fetch_emails", fetch_emails)
workflow.add_node("process_next_email", process_next_email)
workflow.add_node("draft_email", draft_email)
workflow.add_node("validate_draft", validate_draft)
workflow.add_node("send_or_skip_email", send_or_skip_email)

workflow.add_edge(START, "fetch_emails")
workflow.add_edge("fetch_emails", "process_next_email")

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "process_next_email",
    lambda state: END if state.exit else "draft_email" ,
    {"draft_email": "draft_email", END: END}
    )

workflow.add_edge("draft_email", "validate_draft")

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "validate_draft",
    decide_next_step,
    {"send": "send_or_skip_email", "rewrite": "draft_email", "stop": "send_or_skip_email"}
)

workflow.add_edge("send_or_skip_email", "process_next_email")

compiled_email_subgraph = workflow.compile()
```

Want to see how our graph looks?

```python
initial_state = EmailState()

from IPython.display import Image, display
try:
    display(Image(compiled_email_subgraph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    pass
```

![](/assets/blog/agentic-rag-using-langgraph-building-a-simple-customer-support-autonomous-agent/langgraph-1.png)

You can match the graph working with what we discussed the in the workflow. Let's put it to work. (Uncomment the commented lines if you want to see the `State` at each point)

```python
print(Fore.GREEN + "Starting workflow..." + Style.RESET_ALL)
for output in compiled_email_subgraph.stream(initial_state):
    for key, value in output.items():
        print(Fore.CYAN + f"Finished running: {key}" + Style.RESET_ALL)
        # print(Fore.YELLOW + f"State after {key}:" + Style.RESET_ALL)
        # print(value)
```

![](/assets/blog/agentic-rag-using-langgraph-building-a-simple-customer-support-autonomous-agent/langgraph-2.png)

You can see that one case failed after 3 attempts, and one produced a `successfulAgentic` RAG message. Having failure modes means that you may need to tweak your prompts, and/or add validations, reasoning and guidance, depending on the data and use case at hand.

The full code for this workflow is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/customer_support_agent_langgraph/LangGraph_LanceDB.ipynb).


### Final Notes

So now that we've built a working agent that takes care of things for you, one thing to notice is that it relies heavily on fetching the right context. This is where LanceDB stands out as a powerful tool, because of its ability to efficiently handle large-scale vector search thus making it an invaluable tool, whether you're doing a quick PoC or taking your AI workflows to production.

Stay tuned to this blog to learn some advanced Agentic concepts (like human-in-the-loop, memory, multi-agents etc.), each of which can be further enhanced by LanceDB's powerful capabilities. Till next time!
