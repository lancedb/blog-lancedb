Vector databases often come with an unwelcome surprise.

Once your RAG or Agentic prototype turns to production traffic, the bill can spike faster than you can say *“token limit.”*

[Vector search engines](https://lancedb.com/docs/concepts/vector-search/) such as [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com), Turbopuffer, Chroma, or [S3 Vectors](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/vectors/) offer a common solution: store your vectors in S3, pay pennies for storage, and only get charged per query.

{{< admonition >}}
Storing 10M vectors with 50% overwrites and 500K queries can cost $500+ with a typical vector database.
[This can easily drop to $50/month](/pricing/) with LanceDB and similar alternatives.
{{< /admonition >}}

This method of storage has become a huge reprieve for petabyte-scale GenAI startups, such as Cursor (Turbopuffer) or [Harvey](https://www.harvey.ai) and Midjourney [(both on LanceDB)](https://www.harvey.ai/blog/enterprise-grade-rag-systems). 

## The Promise of S3 Vectors

[Amazon S3 Vectors](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-s3-vectors-first-cloud-storage-with-native-vector-support-at-scale/) introduces a new class of S3 bucket—a vector index natively embedded into S3 itself. You upload embeddings, attach optional metadata, and query for similarity matches.

The appeal is clear. [S3 storage is inexpensive and centralized.](/docs/concepts/storage/) AWS S3 Vectors, in particular, is an even better proposition. It is vector-native and indexes on your behalf.

**Figure 1:** AWS S3 Vectors integrates with Bedrock, Sagemaker, Athena & OpenSearch, so you can build a full retrieval-augmented generation workflow without leaving AWS.

Need more than GenAI? If you're into analytics and need a lakehouse - just plug it into S3 Tables and get the benefit of first-class vector support and tabular data.

## Wait...Isn't This Just LanceDB?

![Twitter question about vector database costs](/assets/blog/comparison-s3-vectors-lancedb/twitter-question.png)

Thanks for asking, Jim!

S3 Vectors is a black box, but we don't think so - because our open-source LanceDB product [is pretty much the entire AWS stack combined!](/docs/overview/) 

LanceDB is multimodal. This means that it has [Tables](/docs/concepts/tables/) and [Vectors](/docs/concepts/vector-search/) built into the same storage system. This is something that's been increasingly important for companies looking to do analytics, training and feature engineering. 

AWS Athena? Our [Enterprise product](/docs/overview/enterprise/) has SQL built in. Need embeddings? [We've got the API.](/docs/guides/embedding/) OpenSearch? You get the idea.

We agree...the [Multimodal Lakehouse](/docs/) is another way users can harness the power of [Lance format](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/), which makes structured and unstructured data both first-class citizens. 

But let's get to the focus of S3 Vectors - GenAI Builders.

## It's Not That Easy

The trade-off is complexity. Each AWS service introduces its own configuration, IAM policies, and fees. Setting up and maintaining these connections can take as much time as tuning queries.

Let's take a look at a typical RAG workflow with all the AWS services:

```
[Input Text]
     |
[Embed via Bedrock] -------------------------
     |                                       |
[S3 Vectors] (for similarity)        [S3 Tables] (for structured data)
     |                                       |
[OpenSearch] (optional for latency)          |
     |                                       |
     -------------> [LLM via Bedrock] <------
```
That's 5+ services, each with its own cost, IAM model, SDK/API, and potential latency. Also, the AWS announcement is very carefully written to stay ambiguous performance-wise:

> Amazon S3 Vectors is the first cloud object store with native support to store and query vectors with sub-second search capabilities.

However, sub-second latency is just for S3. What about the added latency of OpenSearch? Past this simple workflow, cold start and latency are real considerations when moving past S3 and adding OpenSearch. 

If the vector you need isn’t warmed up in the destination, the request path becomes **AWS S3 Vectors → OpenSearch**, easily pushing p95 well past a second.

## The Delivery of LanceDB

Let's look at LanceDB in a typical RAG stack:

```
[Input Text]
     |
[LanceDB on S3] + [Embedding]/[Indexing]/[Search]/[Reranking]
     |                                       
[LLM via anything]   
```

LanceDB takes a streamlined path. Instead of mixing several services, you use a [single embedded, open-source library.](/docs/overview/) Indexing, search, analytics, and [lakehouse-style table support](/blog/multimodal-lakehouse/) are included (everything except the LLM itself). There are no additional services to monitor, and there is no vendor lock-in.

Whether you run it in a notebook, a serverless function, or on-premise hardware, it behaves consistently.

> While S3 Vectors promises native scale and integration within the AWS ecosystem, LanceDB takes a fundamentally different approach: unified storage for all data types, advanced search APIs, and deep alignment with ML developer workflows.

We believe this simplicity is a significant advantage in enterprise GenAI. Combined with the fact that LanceDB can be [hosted on-prem in completely custom environments](/docs/overview/enterprise/), we offer the flexibility and control enterprises need to meet strict security, compliance, and performance requirements.

## How We See Things

- **How much integration work can your team support?** </br>
If your organization already relies heavily on AWS, S3 Vector may feel natural, but every new integration adds configuration files to maintain. [LanceDB arrives pre-configured](/docs/overview/), offering less flexibility in exchange for reduced setup effort.

- **Do you require lakehouse-grade analytics?** </br>
S3 Vector focuses on storage. If you need ACID tables, versioned datasets, or fast aggregate queries, you must add another service. [LanceDB provides these functions natively](/blog/multimodal-lakehouse/), letting your BI dashboards and ML pipelines rely on one engine.

## Final Thoughts

[S3 Vectors](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/vectors/) is a strong choice for AWS-native workloads, especially when your data already lives in S3 and you need scalable governance, multi-tenant controls, or integrations with Bedrock and Lake Formation.

But for 90% of developers building RAG systems, AI agents, or embedded search features, [LanceDB is the simpler, faster, and more productive choice.](https://www.lancedb.com) It gives you vector search, structured filtering, and local iteration—without needing five cloud services or a DevOps team.

{{< admonition >}}
In the end, S3 Vectors is cloud infrastructure. LanceDB is a developer tool.
