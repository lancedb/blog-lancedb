## ðŸ”¥ Milestone Achieved with $8 Million Seed RoundðŸ”¥

We're proud to announce that LanceDB has closed an $8 million seed round led by CRV, with additional backing from Y Combinator, Essence Venture Capital, and Swift Ventures. This brings total funding to $11M, enabling us to grow our team and better serve our customers and our community.

As the Database for Multimodal AI, we're on a mission to empower AI teams to easily search over billions of vectors, process petabytes of images, and train on trillions of tokens.

## ðŸš€ Lance v2 is Now in Beta

We've been talking for a while about a [new iteration of our file format](__GHOST_URL__/lance-v2/).  We're pleased to announce that the new v2 format is now in available as an opt-in feature for Lance (in release 0.12.1) and LanceDB (release 0.8.2) for users that want to try it out ahead of time and give us some early feedback.

## Good reads

Now that we've shared our plans for a [new file format](__GHOST_URL__/lance-v2/), Lance v2. We are also creating a series of deep dive posts on the design, challenges and limitations in many existing file readers, and how we plan to overcome these. Here are the first two in this series:

- [Columnar File Readers in Depth: Parallelism without Row Groups](__GHOST_URL__/file-readers-in-depth-parallelism-without-row-groups/)
- [Columnar File Readers in Depth: Scheduling vs Decoding](__GHOST_URL__/splitting-scheduling-from-decoding/)
