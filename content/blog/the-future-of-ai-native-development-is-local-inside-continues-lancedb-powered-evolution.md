As Continue offers user-controlled IDE extensions, most of the codebase is written in Typescript, and the data is stored locally in the *~/.continue *folder. The tooling choices are made such that there are no separate processes required to handle database operations. Continue's codebase retrieval features are powered by [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb), as it is the only vectorDB with an embedded Typescript library that is capable of fast lookup times while being stored on disk and also supports SQL-like filtering. 

Continue seamlessly integrated LanceDB to transform codebase search - deploying a production-ready solution in under a day. This rapid implementation not only accelerated development but inherently aligned with Continue‚Äôs foundational principles: a local-first architecture that prioritizes developer privacy and offline capability, ensuring sensitive code never leaves the user‚Äôs machine. With LanceDB, Continue turned its vision of secure, frictionless AI-powered coding into an immediate reality.

## Introduction
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/04/agent.gif)Agent Mode in Continue
Continue reimagines how developers harness AI, transforming it from a rigid tool into an extension of your workflow. With open-source extensions for VS Code and JetBrains, Continue empowers developers to **build, customize, **and** deploy AI coding assistants** tailored to your team‚Äôs unique patterns, preferences, and codebases. Integrate models, prompts, rules, and documentation into a unified toolkit - all within your IDE, and all under your control.

While Continue operates locally by default - storing data securely in your ~/.*continue* directory - it‚Äôs built to transcend individual setups, scaling effortlessly into server or cloud environments for teams. Organizations can extend its core Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system through a flexible context provider API, integrating proprietary databases, internal documentation, or legacy codebases to create tailored AI assistants. By leveraging LanceDB‚Äôs high-performance vector indexing, teams deploy lightning-fast semantic search across distributed codebases, ensuring AI outputs align with internal patterns and practices. Whether for developers iterating locally or organizations orchestrating centralized knowledge graphs, Continue unifies personal agility with enterprise-scale context awareness, all within a single, Typescript-driven platform.

Continue isn‚Äôt just another AI tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a developer-defined ecosystem where you shape how AI accelerates your work. Build smarter, ship faster, and focus on what matters: creating exceptional code.

## Challenge

Developers often work with vast codebases, intricate libraries, and sprawling documentation. Traditional keyword-based search tools struggle to keep pace, failing to surface semantically relevant code snippets, identify nuanced patterns, or retrieve contextually aligned resources. To solve this, Continue required a solution that could:

- *Understand Code Semantics*: Move beyond superficial text matching to analyze the intent and logic behind code, enabling accurate retrieval of functionally similar patterns.
- *Accelerate Developer Workflow*: Deliver instant, context-aware recommendations as developers type, eliminating disruptive latency during critical thinking phases.
- *Scale Seamlessly*: Support massive codebases and diverse programming languages while maintaining consistent performance, even under heavy workloads.

To integrate this capability directly into your open-source VS Code and JetBrains extensions, Continue needed a vector database that prioritized privacy, simplicity, and tight integration with developer environments. The solution had to meet stringent criteria:

- **Native TypeScript Support**: Ensure seamless compatibility with Continue‚Äôs codebase, enabling maintainable, type-safe implementations without external dependencies.
- **Local, Offline-First Storage**: Operate entirely within the ~/.continue directory to guarantee data privacy, eliminate cloud dependencies, and empower developers to work securely offline.
- **Zero-Overhead Architecture**: Run embedded within the IDE process‚Äîno separate database servers or background processes‚Äîto minimize resource consumption and simplify setup.
- **Expressive Filtering Capabilities**: Leverage SQL-like query syntax to enable granular search (e.g., filtering by language, project, or custom metadata) while maintaining blazing-fast retrieval speeds.

Continue‚Äôs requirements for a vector database were unequivocal: it needed an embedded TypeScript library to ensure seamless integration, lightning-fast lookup times even with on-disk storage, and robust SQL-like filtering capabilities to enable precise, context-aware queries. These features were non-negotiable for delivering a performant, developer-centric experience.

## Solution

There are a number of available vector databases which are able to performantly handle large codebases. LanceDB stood out as the **only vector database offering an embedded TypeScript library with local disk storage**, enabling Continue to deliver a frictionless, self-contained experience. Its performance-optimized design ensured sub-millisecond lookup times, even with large codebases, while robust SQL-like filtering allowed developers to refine searches with surgical precision. By storing vectors directly on disk in Lance format, LanceDB also future-proofed Continue‚Äôs architecture, ensuring effortless scalability from local experimentation to enterprise-grade deployments.

> *‚ÄúLanceDB is a good choice for this because it can run in-memory with libraries for both Python and Node.js. This means that in the beginning our developers can focus on writing code rather than setting up infrastructure.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how Continue leverages LanceDB to power its AI-driven code understanding

### Step 1: Code Semantic Embedding

Continue converts code snippets, functions, and documentation into high-dimensional vectors using embedding models (like [Voyage AI‚Äôs code embedding mode](https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/12/04/voyage-code-3/)l). This captures the meaning of code‚Äînot just keywords‚Äîenabling the AI to recognize similarities even when syntax differs (e.g., identifying equivalent logic in Python and JavaScript).

### Step 2: Local Codebase Ingestion

The system crawls your local repository, chunking code into manageable segments (e.g., 10-line blocks). For a 10M-line codebase, this creates ~1M vectors. LanceDB‚Äôs in-memory architecture ensures this process is fast and resource-efficient, while its disk-based storage keeps data persistent and secure.

### Step 3: Indexing for Speed & Precision

Continue calls LanceDB APIs to build vector + scalar indexes. This combination allows Continue to retrieve results in milliseconds, even with massive datasets.

### Step 4: Context-Aware Developer Queries

When a developer searches (‚ÄúHow do we handle API retries?‚Äù) or requests AI assistance, Continue uses LanceDB to:

- Perform a vector search to find semantically related code.
- Apply SQL-like filters (language, project, tags) to refine results.
- Return contextually relevant suggestions directly in the IDE.

### Step 5: Seamless Codebase Updates

As developers work across branches or update code, LanceDB‚Äôs optimizations prevent redundant work:

- No full reindexing: Small changes (e.g., two similar branches) only update affected vectors.
- Embedding flexibility: Swap models (like trying OpenAI vs. custom embeddings) without rebuilding the entire database.
