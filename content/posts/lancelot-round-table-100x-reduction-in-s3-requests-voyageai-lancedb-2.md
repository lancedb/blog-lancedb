To inaugurate the new year, we proudly unveiled the first ‚öîÔ∏è**Lancelot Round Table** in January, celebrating the founding knights who have been instrumental in shaping the future of AI infrastructure since LanceDB's inception. These Lancelot pioneers are driving innovation by implementing and collaborating with `lance` and `lancedb` across their organizations, democratizing access to advanced AI tools, empowering innovators worldwide, and expanding the frontiers of data management.

ü•≥ **Vector Search with LanceDB using Voyage AI's Text and Multimodal Embeddings. **

- You can now directly define a [Voyage embedding](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/embeddings/available_embedding_models/text_embedding_functions/voyageai_embedding/) function and data model, all within LanceDB. Together, this creates a powerful ecosystem for semantic search, enabling developers to build intelligent, context-aware applications with minimal computational overhead.
- Using this new integration makes it incredibly easy to build, experiment, and scale your AI applications to billions of vectors and beyond.
