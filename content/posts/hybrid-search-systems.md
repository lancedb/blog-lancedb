# Hybrid Search Systems: Combining Traditional and Vector Search

Hybrid search systems combine the best of both worlds: traditional keyword-based search and modern vector search. Let's explore how to implement and optimize these systems.

## What is Hybrid Search?

Hybrid search combines:
- Keyword matching
- Vector similarity
- Metadata filtering
- Custom scoring

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Two-Stage Search
- First stage: Keyword matching
- Second stage: Vector similarity
- Combine results with custom scoring

### 2. Parallel Search
- Run both searches simultaneously
- Merge results based on relevance
- Apply custom ranking

### 3. Weighted Combination
- Assign weights to different signals
- Combine scores
- Apply business rules

## Benefits

### 1. Better Results
- More relevant matches
- Better handling of synonyms
- Improved precision and recall

### 2. Flexibility
- Customizable ranking
- Business rule integration
- Adaptable to different use cases

## Implementation Example

```python
def hybrid_search(query, vector_db, keyword_db):
    # Vector search
    vector_results = vector_db.search(query)
    
    # Keyword search
    keyword_results = keyword_db.search(query)
    
    # Combine results
    combined_results = merge_results(
        vector_results,
        keyword_results,
        weights={'vector': 0.7, 'keyword': 0.3}
    )
    
    return rank_results(combined_results)
```

## Best Practices

1. Choose appropriate weights
2. Implement proper result merging
3. Use efficient indexing
4. Regular performance tuning
5. Monitor search quality

## Conclusion

Hybrid search systems offer the best of both worlds, providing more relevant and flexible search capabilities for modern applications.
