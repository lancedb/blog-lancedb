## üî•LanceDB Enterprise Documentation

LanceDB Enterprise transforms your data lake into a high performance vector database that can operate at extreme scale. Serve millions of tables and tens of billions of rows in a single index, improve retrieval quality using hybrid search with blazing fast metadata filters, and up to 200x cheaper with object storage.

## üë©‚ÄçüíªLance Community Office Hour 

We kicked off our first monthly community office hour in Oct, in which the LanceDb team talked about what we're currently working on, discussed rough plans and future roadmap, and answered questions from anyone in the Lance and LanceDB community. The next one is coming up soon, come say hi!

## Good reads

Another deep dive into the Lance file format and explain how Lance uses backpressure to balance parallelism, speedy I/O, streaming computation, and limited RAM usage.

Columnar File Readers in Depth: Backpressure

Streaming data applications can be tricky. When you can read data faster than you can process the data then bad things tend to happen. The most common scenario is you run out of memory and your process crashes. When the process doesn‚Äôt crash, it often breaks performance (e.g. swapping
