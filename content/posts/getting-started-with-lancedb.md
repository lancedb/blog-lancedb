# Getting Started with LanceDB: A Practical Guide

Ready to dive into LanceDB? This practical guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Installation

First, install LanceDB using pip:

```bash
pip install lancedb
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
import lancedb

# Create a new database
db = lancedb.connect("./data")

# Create a table
table = db.create_table("vectors", data=[
    {"id": 1, "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]},
    {"id": 2, "vector": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]}
])

# Perform a similarity search
results = table.search([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]).limit(5).to_list()
```

## Key Concepts
