LanceDB provides powerful multimodal search and retrieval capabilities that can be applied across various industries. Each use case demonstrates how to combine different data types (images, videos, audio, text) with vector embeddings and sparse vectors for intelligent content discovery.

## Available Use Cases

### [Media & Entertainment](/docs/industries/media-entertainment/)
Content discovery and recommendation for studios, streaming platforms, and news agencies. Search across video frames, audio transcripts, promotional images, and descriptive text.

### [E-Commerce & Retail](/docs/industries/ecommerce-retail/)
Visual and textual product search for retailers. Enable shoppers to find products by uploading photos, searching descriptive terms, or filtering by visual match and metadata.

### [Healthcare & Life Sciences](/docs/industries/healthcare-sciences/)
Multimodal clinical retrieval for hospitals and research labs. Combine patient records, medical imaging, lab reports, and doctors' notes for powerful clinical search.

### [Manufacturing & Industrial](/docs/industries/manufacturing/)
Maintenance knowledge systems for factories and equipment vendors. Index repair manuals, annotated schematics, instructional videos, and audio logs from field engineers.

### [Legal & Compliance](/docs/industries/legal-administrative/)
Evidence and case material search for law firms and regulatory bodies. Store and search contracts, legal briefs, audio testimony, video depositions, and annotated exhibits.

### [Hospitality & Travel](/docs/industries/hospitality-travel/)
Guest experience and operations search for hotels, resorts, and travel platforms. Store and search property images, promotional videos, customer reviews, and service logs.

## Common Workflow Pattern

All industry use cases follow a similar pattern:

1. **Ingestion** </br> Import various media types (images, videos, audio, documents)
2. **Metadata Capture** </br> Extract relevant business-specific metadata
3. **Processing** </br> Apply OCR, ASR, and content segmentation
4. **Embedding Generation** </br> Create vector embeddings for each modality
5. **Indexing** </br> Build searchable indexes with LanceDB
6. **Validation** </br> Human review and quality assurance
