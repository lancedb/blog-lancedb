Studios, streaming platforms, and news agencies store and search across video frames, audio transcripts, promotional images, and descriptive text. A journalist could search by a quote to find the exact moment in a video, or a producer could find all clips with a specific visual theme and matching soundtrack tone.

## How LanceDB Works:

Sequence:
1. Raw video, audio, images, and script files are ingested into the database
2. Technical metadata (fps, duration, title, season/episode) is captured and stored
3. Content processing begins: ASR for speech, OCR for on-screen text, script parsing
4. Content is segmented into scenes, shots, and transcript lines
5. Vector embeddings are generated and stored for visual, text, and audio content
6. Human-verified labels are applied for genres, moods, and caption corrections

## Sample Lance Schema:

```json
{
  "table": "media_assets",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "asset_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "title", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "modality", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "video", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "video_mime", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "audio", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "audio_mime", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "keyframes", "type": "array<bytes>"},
    {"name": "poster_image", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "poster_image_mime", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "script_text", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "captions_text", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "scene_segments", "type": "array<object>"},
    {"name": "video_embeddings", "type": "array<array<number>>"},
    {"name": "audio_embeddings", "type": "array<array<number>>"},

  ]
}

## Data Transformation Pipeline

### Initial Data
Raw media files and basic metadata that studios and platforms typically have available.

In the media industry, content creators and distributors often start with unprocessed media files and minimal metadata. These raw assets include the original video files, audio tracks, and script documents that are created during production. At this stage, the data is primarily useful for basic storage and playback, but lacks the structured information needed for intelligent search and discovery.

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `asset_id` | string | Unique identifier for the media asset | "movie_12345" |
| `title` | string | Title of the content | "The Great Adventure" |
| `video_file` | bytes | Raw video file | MP4 binary data |
| `audio_file` | bytes | Raw audio file | WAV binary data |
| `script_pdf` | bytes | Original script document | PDF binary data |
| `release_date` | string | When content was released | "2024-01-15" |
| `genre` | string | Basic genre classification | "Action" |

### Extracted Features
Information derived through AI processing and feature engineering.

Through advanced AI processing, these raw media files are transformed into searchable, analyzable features that enable powerful content discovery. Video analysis models can identify visual themes, scenes, and objects. Audio processing extracts speech, music, and sound effects. Text analysis provides semantic understanding of scripts and captions. This transformation enables journalists to find specific quotes across video archives, producers to discover content with matching visual aesthetics, and content managers to organize libraries by themes and moods.

| Field | Type | Description | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `video_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of video frames | Video analysis model |
| `audio_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of audio segments | Audio analysis model |
| `text_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of script text | Text embedding model |
| `scene_segments` | array<object> | Timestamped scene boundaries | Video scene detection |
| `transcript_text` | string | Speech-to-text from audio | ASR model |
| `on_screen_text` | string | Text detected in video frames | OCR model |
| `mood_labels` | array<string> | Emotional tone classifications | Content analysis |
| `sparse_terms` | object | Keyword frequency vectors | TF-IDF extraction |
