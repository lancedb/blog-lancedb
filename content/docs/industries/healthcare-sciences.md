Hospitals and research labs combine patient records, medical imaging (X-rays, MRIs), lab reports, and doctors' notes. A clinician could search by symptom text to find matching case images, or by an MRI scan to retrieve similar cases and associated treatment outcomes.

## How LanceDB Works:

Sequence:
1. Medical images, reports, and audio recordings are ingested into the database
2. Clinical metadata (modality, device ID, anonymized demographics) is captured and stored
3. Content processing begins: OCR for scanned documents, ASR for doctor dictations
4. Content is segmented into image slices, report paragraphs, and timeline events
5. Vector embeddings are generated and stored for images and text content
6. Clinician-validated findings, adjusted annotations, and confirmed diagnoses are applied

## Sample Lance Schema:

```json
{
  "table": "clinical_retrieval",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "study_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "patient_pseudo_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "modality", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "dicom_image", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "dicom_mime", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "report_text", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "dictation_audio", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "dictation_audio_mime", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "image_regions", "type": "array<object>"},
    {"name": "timeline_events", "type": "array<object>"},
    {"name": "image_embeddings", "type": "array<array<number>>"},
    {"name": "text_embeddings", "type": "array<array<number>>"},
    {"name": "sparse_terms", "type": "object"},

## Data Transformation Pipeline

### Initial Data
Raw medical files and basic patient information available in clinical systems.

Healthcare organizations begin with unstructured medical data that's essential for patient care but challenging to search and analyze systematically. This includes medical images from various imaging modalities, scanned documents like lab reports and patient records, and audio recordings of doctor-patient interactions. While these files contain critical clinical information, they're often stored in siloed systems that make cross-referencing and pattern recognition difficult. Clinicians need to manually review multiple sources to find relevant case histories or similar diagnostic patterns.

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `study_id` | string | Unique study identifier | "STUDY_456" |
| `patient_id` | string | Patient identifier | "PT_789" |
| `modality` | string | Imaging modality | "MRI" |
| `dicom_file` | bytes | Raw DICOM image | DICOM binary data |
| `report_pdf` | bytes | Scanned medical report | PDF binary data |
| `audio_recording` | bytes | Doctor's dictation | WAV binary data |
| `exam_date` | string | Date of examination | "2024-01-20" |

### Extracted Features
Clinical insights derived through medical AI and analysis.

Advanced medical AI transforms raw clinical data into structured, searchable insights that enhance diagnostic accuracy and research capabilities. Medical imaging models can identify anatomical structures, detect pathologies, and measure quantitative features. Natural language processing extracts clinical concepts, diagnoses, and treatment plans from unstructured text. This transformation enables radiologists to find similar cases for comparison, researchers to identify patterns across patient populations, and clinicians to quickly access relevant medical literature and case studies. The extracted features support evidence-based medicine and accelerate clinical decision-making.

| Field | Type | Description | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `image_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of medical images | Medical vision model |
| `text_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of report text | Medical NLP model |
| `anatomical_regions` | array<object> | Identified body parts/organs | Medical image segmentation |
| `pathology_findings` | array<string> | Detected medical conditions | Medical AI analysis |
| `clinical_codes` | array<string> | ICD-10/SNOMED codes | Medical coding extraction |
| `temporal_events` | array<object> | Timeline of medical events | Temporal analysis |
| `risk_factors` | array<string> | Identified risk factors | Clinical risk assessment |
| `sparse_terms` | object | Medical terminology vectors | Medical TF-IDF |
