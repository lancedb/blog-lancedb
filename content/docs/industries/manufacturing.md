Factories and equipment vendors index repair manuals, annotated schematics, instructional videos, and audio logs from field engineers. An operator could upload a photo of a faulty part to find relevant manuals, watch repair videos, and review past troubleshooting conversations.

## How LanceDB Works:

Sequence:
1. Manuals, schematics, images, videos, and audio files are ingested into the database
2. Equipment metadata (machine ID, part number, revision info) is captured and stored
3. Content processing begins: OCR for schematics, ASR for audio logs, manual parsing
4. Content is segmented into manual steps, video instructions, and schematic regions
5. Cross-modal vector embeddings are generated and stored
6. Technician-verified instructions, updated specifications, and approved safety tags are applied

## Sample Lance Schema:

  "table": "industrial_knowledge",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "record_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "machine_id", "type": "string"},

## Data Transformation Pipeline

### Initial Data
Basic documentation and media files that manufacturing companies typically have.

Manufacturing organizations maintain extensive technical documentation that's critical for operations but often difficult to navigate efficiently. This includes equipment manuals, technical schematics, training videos, and procedural documents that are essential for maintenance, training, and compliance. While these resources contain valuable knowledge, they're typically stored in separate systems or file formats that make it challenging for technicians to quickly find relevant information during critical operations. The raw data exists but isn't optimized for the fast-paced, safety-critical environment of industrial operations.

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `record_id` | string | Unique record identifier | "REC_123" |
| `machine_id` | string | Equipment identifier | "MACH_456" |
| `part_number` | string | Part identifier | "PN_789" |
| `manual_pdf` | bytes | Equipment manual | PDF binary data |
| `schematic_image` | bytes | Technical diagram | PNG binary data |
| `procedure_video` | bytes | Training video | MP4 binary data |
| `revision_date` | string | Document revision date | "2024-01-10" |

### Extracted Features
Technical insights derived through engineering analysis and AI.

AI-powered engineering analysis transforms static documentation into dynamic, searchable knowledge systems that enhance operational efficiency and safety. Computer vision models can identify components in schematics, extract technical specifications from images, and analyze procedural videos for step-by-step guidance. Natural language processing extracts key technical terms, safety warnings, and maintenance procedures from text. This transformation enables technicians to quickly locate relevant procedures, engineers to find similar equipment configurations, and safety officers to identify compliance requirements across multiple documents. The extracted features support predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and improve training effectiveness.

| Field | Type | Description | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `image_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of schematics | Engineering vision model |
| `text_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of manual text | Technical NLP model |
| `video_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of procedure videos | Video analysis model |
| `step_sequences` | array<object> | Procedural step breakdown | Video/audio segmentation |
| `safety_indicators` | array<string> | Safety warnings and requirements | Safety analysis |
| `technical_specs` | array<object> | Extracted technical specifications | Document parsing |
| `maintenance_schedules` | array<object> | Predicted maintenance timing | Predictive analytics |
| `sparse_terms` | object | Technical terminology vectors | Engineering TF-IDF |
