Law firms and regulatory bodies store contracts, legal briefs, audio testimony, video depositions, and annotated exhibits. Investigators can search for a phrase from a transcript to jump to the corresponding video, or cross-reference an image of an exhibit with related legal arguments in text.

## How LanceDB Works:

Sequence:
1. Contracts, briefs, exhibits, depositions, and testimony are ingested into the database
2. Case metadata (case ID, jurisdiction, filing date) is captured and stored
3. Content processing begins: OCR for scanned exhibits, ASR for depositions, brief parsing
4. Content is segmented into clauses, testimony turns, and exhibit regions
5. Vector embeddings are generated and stored for text and media content
6. Attorney-highlighted clauses, risk tags, and privileged content flags are applied

## Sample Lance Schema:

```json
{
  "table": "legal_evidence",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "case_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "jurisdiction", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "filing_date", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "contract_pdf", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "contract_pdf_mime", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "exhibits", "type": "array<bytes>"},
    {"name": "exhibit_mimes", "type": "array<string>"},
    {"name": "deposition_video", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "deposition_video_mime", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "testimony_audio", "type": "bytes"},
    {"name": "testimony_audio_mime", "type": "string"},

## Data Transformation Pipeline

### Initial Data
Basic legal documents and media files that law firms typically store.

Legal organizations manage vast collections of case materials that are essential for litigation, compliance, and legal research but challenging to search systematically. This includes contracts, legal briefs, evidence exhibits, deposition recordings, and court documents that contain critical legal information. While these materials are meticulously organized by case, they're often stored in various formats and systems that make cross-referencing and pattern recognition difficult. Attorneys and paralegals spend significant time manually searching through multiple sources to find relevant precedents, similar cases, or supporting evidence.

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `case_id` | string | Unique case identifier | "CASE_123" |
| `jurisdiction` | string | Legal jurisdiction | "Federal Court" |
| `filing_date` | string | Date filed | "2024-01-15" |
| `contract_pdf` | bytes | Legal contract | PDF binary data |
| `exhibit_images` | array<bytes> | Evidence photos | JPEG binary data |
| `deposition_video` | bytes | Video testimony | MP4 binary data |
| `brief_text` | string | Legal brief text | Plain text |

### Extracted Features
Legal insights derived through legal AI and analysis.

Advanced legal AI transforms unstructured case materials into searchable, analyzable legal knowledge that enhances case preparation and research efficiency. Natural language processing extracts legal concepts, identifies contract clauses, and analyzes case arguments. Computer vision analyzes evidence exhibits, identifies key visual elements, and extracts text from scanned documents. Audio analysis transcribes depositions and identifies key testimony moments. This transformation enables attorneys to quickly find relevant case law, paralegals to identify similar contract terms, and investigators to cross-reference evidence across multiple cases. The extracted features support legal research, risk assessment, and compliance monitoring.

| Field | Type | Description | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `text_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of legal text | Legal NLP model |
| `media_embeddings` | array<array<number>> | Vector representations of evidence media | Media analysis model |
| `clause_annotations` | array<object> | Identified contract clauses | Legal text parsing |
| `risk_assessments` | array<string> | Identified legal risks | Risk analysis |
| `privilege_flags` | array<string> | Attorney-client privilege indicators | Privilege detection |
| `temporal_sequences` | array<object> | Timeline of legal events | Temporal analysis |
| `legal_citations` | array<string> | Referenced case law | Citation extraction |
| `sparse_terms` | object | Legal terminology vectors | Legal TF-IDF |
