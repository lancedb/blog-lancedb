**LanceDB** is a high-performance, open-source vector database designed for AI, search, and analytics at scale. Use this documentation to build production-ready applications with a simple API to store, search, and manage vector data alongside rich metadata. LanceDB’s flexible features enable neural search, semantic retrieval, hybrid queries, and more.

With [**LanceDB Cloud**](/cloud/), you can build secure, scalable, and high-performance vector search solutions. Manage your clusters through the [LanceDB Cloud UI](/docs/cloud/), or run LanceDB on your own infrastructure for complete control and data sovereignty.

## First-Time Users:

There are three ways to get started with LanceDB:

1. [**Local Setup**](/docs/quickstart/) - `pip install lancedb` and run complex queries in five steps.
2. [**5-Minute Chatbot**](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) - Build AI apps with embedded & lightweight vector search and storage.
3. [**Cloud Deployment**](/cloud/) - Launch scalable clusters and prepare for production use cases.

## Recommended Workflow:

Start by experimenting with LanceDB locally using the [Python Client](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) and our [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/). Build a sample app from our [Demos](/docs/examples/) and build it with [LanceBD Cloud](/docs/guides/installation/). When you’re ready for production, deploy to a Free Tier [LanceDB Cloud](/cloud/) cluster.
