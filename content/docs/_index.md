With [**LanceDB Cloud**](/cloud/), you can build secure, scalable, and high-performance vector search solutions. Manage your clusters through the [LanceDB Cloud UI](/docs/cloud/), or run LanceDB on your own infrastructure for complete control and data sovereignty.

## First-Time Users:

There are three ways to get started with LanceDB:

1. [**Local Setup**](/docs/quickstart/) - `pip install lancedb` and run complex queries in five steps.
2. [**5-Minute Chatbot**](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) - Build AI apps with embedded & lightweight vector search and storage.
3. [**Cloud Deployment**](/cloud/) - Launch scalable clusters and prepare for production use cases.

## Recommended Workflow:

Build a sample app from our [Demos](/docs/examples/) and build it with [LanceBD Cloud](/docs/guides/installation/). When youâ€™re ready for production, deploy to a Free Tier [LanceDB Cloud](/cloud/) cluster.
