# Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts and principles that underpin LanceDB's architecture and functionality.

## Overview

| Concept | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Tables** | Understanding LanceDB tables, their structure, and how they store and organize data | [Tables](/docs/concepts/tables/) |
| **Search** | Vector search capabilities, similarity search, and retrieval mechanisms | [Search](/docs/concepts/search/) |
| **Indexing** | Index types, creation, and optimization for efficient data retrieval | [Indexing](/docs/concepts/indexing/) |
| **Storage** | Storage formats, file organization, and data persistence strategies | [Storage](/docs/concepts/storage/) |
| **Embedding** | Vector embeddings, model integration, and embedding workflows | [Embedding](/docs/concepts/embedding/) |

## Getting Started

Start with the [Tables](/docs/concepts/tables/) concept to understand the fundamental data structure, then explore [Search](/docs/concepts/search/) and [Indexing](/docs/concepts/indexing/) to learn about retrieval mechanisms. The [Storage](/docs/concepts/storage/) section covers how data is persisted, while [Embedding](/docs/concepts/embedding/) explains vector representation and model integration.
