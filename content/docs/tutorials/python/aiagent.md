# AI Agents: Intelligent Collaboration

Think of a platform where AI Agents can seamlessly exchange information, coordinate over tasks, and achieve shared targets with great efficiency.

## Vector-Based Coordination: The Technical Advantage
Leveraging LanceDB's vector-based capabilities, we can enable AI agents  to communicate and collaborate through dense vector representations. AI agents can exchange information, coordinate on a task or work towards a common goal, just by giving queries.
