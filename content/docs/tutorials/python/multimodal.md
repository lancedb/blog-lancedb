# Multimodal Search with LanceDB

Using LanceDB's multimodal capabilities, combine text and image queries to find the most relevant results in your corpus ! 

Explore the Future of Search 

LanceDB supports multimodal search by indexing and querying vector representations of text and image data . This enables efficient retrieval of relevant documents and images using vector-based similarity search . The platform facilitates cross-modal search, allowing for text-image and image-text retrieval, and supports scalable indexing of high-dimensional vector spaces .
