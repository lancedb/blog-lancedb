RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with LanceDB 
====================================================================
Build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with  LanceDB, a powerful solution for efficient vector-based information retrieval . 
Experience the Future of Search 
 RAG enables AI to retrieve relevant information from external sources and use it to generate more accurate and context-specific responses.  LanceDB provides a robust framework for integrating LLMs with external knowledge sources .
| RAG | Description |
|:----|:------------|
| [RAG with Matryoshka Embeddings and LlamaIndex](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/tutorials/RAG-with_MatryoshkaEmbed-Llamaindex) | Utilize Matryoshka embeddings and LlamaIndex to improve the efficiency and accuracy of your RAG models. |
| [Improve RAG with Re-ranking](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/RAG_Reranking) | Enhance your RAG applications by implementing re-ranking strategies for more relevant document retrieval. |
| [Instruct-Multitask](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/instruct-multitask) | Integrate the Instruct Embedding Model with LanceDB to streamline your embedding API, reducing redundant code and overhead. |
| [Improve RAG with HyDE](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/Advance-RAG-with-HyDE) | Use Hypothetical Document Embeddings for efficient, accurate, and unsupervised dense retrieval. |
| [Improve RAG with LOTR](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/Advance_RAG_LOTR) | Enhance RAG with Lord of the Retriever (LOTR) to address 'Lost in the Middle' challenges, especially in medical data. |
| [Advanced RAG: Parent Document Retriever](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/parent_document_retriever) | Use Parent Document & Bigger Chunk Retriever to maintain context and relevance when generating related content. |
| [Corrective RAG with Langgraph](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/tutorials/Corrective-RAG-with_Langgraph) | Enhance RAG reliability with Corrective RAG (CRAG) by self-reflecting and fact-checking for accurate and trustworthy results. |
| [Contextual Compression with RAG](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/Contextual-Compression-with-RAG) | Apply contextual compression techniques to condense large documents while retaining essential information. |
| [Improve RAG with FLARE](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/better-rag-FLAIR) | Enable users to ask questions directly to academic papers, focusing on ArXiv papers, with Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation. |
| [Query Expansion and Reranker](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/tree/main/examples/archived_examples/QueryExpansion%26Reranker) | Enhance RAG with query expansion using Large Language Models and advanced reranking methods like Cross Encoders, ColBERT v2, and FlashRank for improved document retrieval precision and recall |
| [RAG Fusion](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/tree/main/examples/archived_examples/RAG_Fusion) | Build RAG Fusion, utilize the RRF algorithm to rerank documents based on user queries ! Use LanceDB as vector database to store and retrieve documents related to queries via OPENAI Embeddings |
| [Agentic RAG](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/tutorials/Agentic_RAG) | Build autonomous information retrieval with Agentic RAG, a framework of intelligent agents that collaborate to synthesize, summarize, and compare data across sources, that enables proactive and informed decision-making |
