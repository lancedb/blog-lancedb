[**Kiln**](https://kiln.tech) is a free tool for building production-ready AI systems, combining an intuitive desktop application and an open-source Python library. It supports RAG pipelines, evaluations, agents, MCP tool-calling, synthetic data generation, and fine-tuning. Kiln provides deep integration with LanceDB for vector search, full-text search (BM25), and hybrid search. 

## Quick Start: Build a RAG Pipeline in 5 Minutes with Kiln & LanceDB

{{< vimeo 1119945690 >}}

<br>

Kiln's [app](https://kiln.tech/download) makes it easy to:

 - Build a RAG pipeline with a simple drag-and-drop interface
 - [Compare](#find-the-best-rag-pipeline-for-your-use-case) search index options (powered by LanceDB), document extractors, embedding models, and chunking strategies
 - Create end-to-end [evaluations](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/evaluations) to determine which search configuration works best for your use case
 - Load your data from Kiln into LanceDB Cloud for production use
 - Iterate with confidence by evaluating new content, prompts, models, and embeddings in minutes instead of weeks

## Find the Best RAG Pipeline for Your Use Case

There is no universal best RAG solutionâ€”only the best solution for your specific use case. Kiln makes it easy to compare state-of-the-art configurations and find which works best for you.

Start with pre-configured templates for state-of-the-art RAG at various performance/quality/cost levels, or experiment with any combination of options:

|Area|Technologies|Description|
|:----|:----|:----|
|Search Index|LanceDB|Compare LanceDB's vector search, full-text search (BM25), and hybrid search to find the best approach for your use case.|
|Content|Kiln Document Library|Collaborate on a document library with your team to find the best content for your RAG. Track every revision and tag document sets.|
|Document Extraction|Gemini, OpenAI GPT, Qwen VL, and more|Find the most accurate document extraction models for converting PDFs, images, audio, video, and other formats into textual data for RAG.|
|Embeddings|Embedding models from Gemini, OpenAI, Nomic, Qwen, and more|Find the embedding model best suited to your use case.|
|Chunking|LlamaIndex|Find the ideal chunk size and method.|

## Get Started

To get started, download the [Kiln App](https://kiln.tech/download), create a project, and navigate to "Docs & Search".

See the [Kiln documentation for creating a RAG system](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/documents-and-search-rag) for details on each step of the process.
